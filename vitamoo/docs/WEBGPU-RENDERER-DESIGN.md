# WebGPU renderer: upgrade and advanced features

Design for replacing the current WebGL renderer with a WebGPU-only backend and extending it to support Sims-style holodeck rendering: z-buffered sprites, procedural terrain and architecture, and UI feedback (highlighting, selection, pie menu).

---

## 1. WebGL to WebGPU upgrade

### 1.1 Current surface (vitamoo)

All GPU use is in **vitamoo**:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `vitamoo/renderer.ts` | Single `Renderer` class, WebGL 1 context, one vertex + one fragment shader (GLSL). Methods: `clear`, `fadeScreen`, `setCamera`, `setCulling`, `drawMesh`, `drawDiamond`, `loadTexture`. Exposes `context` (WebGLRenderingContext) for texture upload. |
| `vitamoo/texture.ts` | `parseBMP` (pure); `loadTexture(url, gl)` creates and uploads a WebGLTexture. |

**mooshow** uses only: `new Renderer(canvas)`, then `clear`, `setCamera`, `context.viewport(…)`, `fadeScreen`, `drawMesh`, `drawDiamond`, and `loader.setGL(renderer.context)` so the content loader can create textures. No other WebGL calls.

### 1.2 Target WebGPU surface

- **Device/queue:** `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` → `adapter.requestDevice()`; use one `GPUDevice` and its default `queue` for the lifetime of the renderer.
- **Canvas:** `canvas.getContext('webgpu')`, configure with `device`, `format`, and optional `alphaMode`. Resize and get current texture each frame.
- **Shaders:** WGSL. One or more shader modules; at least:
  - **Mesh pass:** vertex (position, normal, uv, MVP, light direction) → fragment (diffuse + texture, alpha, optional fade color). Matches current GLSL behavior.
  - **Fullscreen quad pass:** for `fadeScreen` (motion blur overlay).
  - **Diamond (plumb bob):** same mesh pipeline with solid color and no texture; or a tiny dedicated pipeline.
- **Pipelines:** `GPURenderPipeline` for mesh, for fullscreen quad, and for diamond if separate. Shared bind group layout for uniforms (projection, modelView, lightDir, alpha, fadeColor, texture).
- **Buffers:** `GPUBuffer` for vertex/index data. Uniforms in a small `GPUBuffer` updated each frame (or per draw). No long-lived vertex buffers for dynamic meshes unless we adopt staging buffers and copy.
- **Textures:** `loadTexture` becomes `loadTexture(device, url)` (or `device` + queue), returns `GPUTexture` (or an opaque handle the renderer accepts in `drawMesh`). Upload via `queue.copyExternalImageToTexture` from `createImageBitmap` or from decoded BMP data.
- **Public API preserved:** `clear`, `setCamera`, `setViewport` (method on renderer, no raw context), `fadeScreen`, `drawMesh(mesh, verts, norms, texture)`, `drawDiamond(…)`. Callers (mooshow stage, content-loader) receive a device or a texture-upload interface instead of `gl`; they never touch WebGPU objects except through the renderer.

### 1.3 Shader migration (GLSL → WGSL)

- **Vertex:** `aPosition`, `aNormal`, `aTexCoord` → `@location(0)` position, `@location(1)` normal, `@location(2)` texCoord. Output position, uv, normal to fragment. Uniforms: `uProjection`, `uModelView` (or single `uModelViewProjection`).
- **Fragment:** `vTexCoord`, `vNormal` from vertex; `uniform sampler2D uTexture`, `uniform bool uHasTexture`, `uLightDir`, `uAlpha`, `uFadeColor`. Same math: if `uFadeColor` is “use fade” sentinel, output fade color; else diffuse + texture or untextured gray. WGSL uses `textureSample`, `textureSampleLevel`, and `@binding`/`@group` for texture and sampler.
- **Fullscreen quad:** vertex outputs NDC position and optional uv; fragment samples nothing (solid color) for fadeScreen. Uniform: clear color + alpha.
- **Entry points:** `@vertex` and `@fragment` per pipeline.

### 1.4 Phases

1. **Parity:** Replace `renderer.ts` and `loadTexture` with WebGPU; keep the same public API and behavior (skinned mesh, motion blur, plumb bob). No new features. mooshow passes device (or renderer’s texture factory) to the loader; viewport set via `renderer.setViewport`.
2. **Object-ID and layered sprites (optional next):** Add a second pass or alternate pipeline that writes object ID (e.g. R32Uint or packed RGB) for picking and for baking RGB+alpha+z layers for object authoring.
3. **Advanced features:** Sims-style pipeline, procedural architecture, and UI shader effects (below).

---

## 2. Advanced WebGPU renderer — Sims-style pipeline

### 2.1 Holodeck composition

- **Background:** Pre-rendered or procedurally generated: terrain, floors, walls, roofs, and static props. Rendered first into the same depth buffer (or a separate depth that we merge). Can be:
  - Pre-rendered RGB+alpha+z sprites (layered images with depth), or
  - Procedural geometry drawn in the same pass (terrain, tiles, walls, roofs from shaders).
- **Characters:** Real-time vitamoo skinned meshes (current `drawMesh` path). Drawn after the background with depth test on, so they correctly occlude and are occluded.
- **Order:** (1) Clear. (2) Draw background (sprites and/or procedural) with depth write. (3) Draw 3D characters with depth test and write. (4) Optional: UI overlay (pie menu, feedback).

One camera, one depth buffer, one render pass (or a small number of passes) so composition stays simple and correct.

### 2.2 Z-buffered sprites

- **Input:** Per-object or per-layer RGBA + depth (e.g. from object-ID / bake pass, or from pre-rendered assets). Sprites are screen-aligned or billboarded quads with texture (RGB+A) and depth.
- **Composition:** Draw sprites in back-to-front or use depth buffer: draw each sprite with its depth so characters and other geometry correctly interleave. Same pipeline as “background” above when background is image-based.
- **Object creation:** 3D model (OBJ, glTF, or Sims assets) → render to RGB + alpha + z → export as layered sprite for use in holodeck or in object tools.

### 2.3 Object-ID and picking

- **ID pass:** Optional render pass that writes a stable object ID per pixel (e.g. integer in R or RGB). Read back on click or sample in a small region to resolve which object was picked. Supports both procedural geometry and sprites if we assign IDs consistently.
- **Layered sprite authoring:** Same ID or a separate “bake” pass used to generate the RGB+alpha+z layers for new objects.

## 3. Shader scope — how much in shaders

Goal: push as much Sims-style look and feel into shaders as we can (performance, consistency, single pipeline). Below is a concrete list; implementation order can follow parity first, then background/terrain, then UI.

### 3.1 Terrain

- **Options:** (a) Heightfield from texture or vertex grid, (b) tiled terrain with repeating or blended tiles, (c) fully procedural (noise-based height + optional texture). Shaders: vertex displacing by height, fragment for color (texture sample or procedural). We can start with a simple grid + height texture and add procedural variation later.

### 3.2 Floor tiles

- **Grid:** Vertex buffer or instancing for a grid of quads. UVs for tile index or atlas. Shader: sample floor tile atlas; optional edge lines or pattern (e.g. checker) in fragment. Tiling and repetition fully in shader.

### 3.3 Walls

- **Quads or boxes:** Planar geometry with normals. Shader: diffuse (and optional simple procedural pattern or texture). Wall edges or trim can be a separate pass or same pass with different UVs. Lighting from shared directional/ambient.

### 3.4 Roofs

- **Pitched planes:** Triangles or quads for roof faces. Shader: tiling texture or procedural (e.g. shingle pattern). Same lighting model as walls. Can be instanced for repeated roof segments.

### 3.5 Lighting

- **Current (keep):** Directional light from camera direction + bias; diffuse in fragment.
- **Extend in shaders:** Ambient term (constant or from uniform). Optional: second light (fill). No need for full PBR initially; keep “Sims-style” simple diffuse + ambient.
- **Shadows (optional):** Simple shadow map or fake “blob” under characters; can be a later pass. Not required for first advanced pass.

### 3.6 Highlighting (hover)

- **Options:** (a) Outline pass (render object again with scaled geometry and solid color), (b) tint overlay (multiply or add a color in fragment when “highlight” uniform is set), (c) second pass that adds a highlight color where object-ID matches hovered ID. Prefer (b) or (c) to avoid double geometry; can be a uniform on the existing mesh pipeline: `uHighlight (vec3 or vec4)` and blend in fragment.

### 3.7 Selection

- **Object-ID:** Already covered; click resolves ID. Visual: same as highlighting (tint or outline) keyed by “selected” ID. Optional: thicker outline or different color for selection vs hover.

### 3.8 Feedback (click / state)

- **In shader:** Brief flash or pulse: e.g. `uFeedback` (float 0..1) that lerps or multiplies with base color. Driven by JS timer. No new geometry; just a uniform on mesh or fullscreen overlay.

### 3.9 Pie menu

- **Background:** Desaturated version of the scene behind the menu. Options: (a) Copy current framebuffer to a texture, then draw a fullscreen quad that samples it and desaturates (e.g. dot with gray weights) and optionally darkens; (b) Re-render scene with a desaturate-only fragment shader to an offscreen texture, then draw that as background. (a) is simpler if we have a resolve/copy path.
- **Feather / vignette:** Fullscreen quad with radial gradient (soft falloff) so the center is clear and the edges fade to a shadow color. Drawn after the desaturated background. Alpha blend.
- **Shadows:** “Drop shadow” behind the pie: draw the pie shape (or a rounded rect) slightly offset and blurred (or with a soft edge) in a dark color, then draw the pie on top. Can be a simple soft quad or a small blur in a shader (e.g. 4-tap or 9-tap blur on a small texture). All of this can live in one “UI overlay” pass with 2–3 draws: desaturated bg, feather, shadow, then menu content.
- **Head in pie menu:** The character animation system already supports rendering only the head (e.g. head mesh/suit in local or bone-local coordinates, as in the original vitaboy “drawing the people's heads in the center of the pie menu”). The WebGPU renderer reuses the same mesh pipeline: draw the head mesh with the appropriate camera and transform so the Sim’s head appears in the center of the pie. No new shader; just a dedicated draw call with head-only geometry and optional scale/position for the menu.

### 3.10 Summary table

## 4. Implementation order (suggested)

1. **WebGL → WebGPU parity** (renderer + texture, same API, no new features).
2. **setViewport** and loader texture interface (device or factory) so mooshow and vitamoospace work unchanged.
3. **Object-ID pass** (optional) for picking and future baking.
4. **Background layer:** z-buffered sprites and/or procedural terrain + floor (minimal: grid + height + one tile texture).
5. **Walls and roofs** (procedural or tiled in shaders).
6. **Lighting** (ambient + directional in fragment).
7. **Highlight / selection / feedback** (uniforms + one small overlay pass if needed).
8. **Pie menu** (desaturated bg, feather, shadow) when the app adds a pie UI.

## 5. Advanced goal: GPU-side skeletal deformation

**Idea:** Upload all undeformed character meshes and skeletons to the GPU once; run skeletal mesh deformation (and ideally animation) on the GPU; render from the resulting mesh state without streaming deformed vertices back from the CPU each frame.

### 5.1 Current divide

Today the CPU owns the pipeline: `updateTransforms(bones)` and `deformMesh(mesh, bones, boneMap)` produce deformed vertices and normals in JS; the renderer uploads those to the GPU every frame and draws. Mesh and skeleton data live in CPU memory; only the final deformed buffers are sent to the GPU each frame.

### 5.2 Target: data on GPU, animate on GPU

- **Upload once (or at load):** For each character, upload to GPU and keep there:
  - **Undeformed mesh:** positions, normals, UVs, indices; plus **bone bindings** (per-bone: firstVertex, vertexCount, firstBlendedVertex, blendedVertexCount) and **blend bindings** (otherVertexIndex, weight). These are static per mesh.
  - **Skeleton:** hierarchy (parent indices or structure), rest pose (local position, rotation per bone). Static per character.
  - **Animation data (optional):** Keyframes or motion curves per bone (translation, rotation over time) so the GPU can derive current pose from a time uniform.
- **Animate on GPU:** Two possible levels:
  - **Option A — Deformation only on GPU:** CPU still runs `Practice.tick` and computes bone world poses each frame; upload only the current bone matrices (or position+rotation) to a uniform/storage buffer. A **compute shader** (or vertex shader, if we restructure — see below) performs the same Phase 0 / Phase 1 / Blend logic as `deformMesh`, writing deformed positions and normals to a GPU buffer. The render pass then draws from that buffer. No deformed data leaves the GPU; only a small bone-matrix upload per frame.
  - **Option B — Full GPU animation:** Time (and maybe skill/sequence ID) is uploaded each frame. A **compute shader** evaluates animation (keyframe interpolation, or sample from textures) to produce bone world matrices, then runs the same deformation logic and writes deformed mesh buffer. No per-frame skeleton or mesh data from CPU; only time (and optionally a few parameters).
- **Render from GPU output:** The mesh draw uses the buffer filled by the deformation pass (positions, normals; UVs and indices are unchanged). One compute pass per character (or batched), then one draw per character from the deformed buffer. No readback of deformed vertices to CPU.

So yes: we can download (upload) all undeformed meshes and skeletons to the GPU and leave them there; then animate and deform on the GPU and render from that state.

### 5.3 Implementing the current deformation model on GPU

The vitamoo deformation model (see `skeleton.ts`) is:

- **Phase 0:** Each bone transforms its “bound” vertices (position and normal) by its world position and rotation.
- **Phase 1:** Each bone transforms its “blended” vertices (stored at offset `boundCount` in the vertex array).
- **Blend:** Each blend binding lerps a blended vertex into a bound vertex: `destVert = lerp(destByBoneA, blendByBoneB, weight)` (and same for normals, normalized).

This is not the usual per-vertex “bone indices + weights” skinning; it’s bone-ranged and then a blend pass. It maps cleanly to a **compute shader**:

- **Input buffers (read-only, resident on GPU):** undeformed vertices/normals, bone bindings (bone index, firstVertex, vertexCount, firstBlendedVertex, blendedVertexCount), blend bindings (otherVertexIndex, weight), and per-frame bone world matrices (position.xyz + rotation quat or 3×3).
- **Output buffer (write):** deformed positions and normals (same layout as current `drawMesh` input).
- **Dispatch:** One thread per vertex (or per binding range); implement Phase 0 and Phase 1 by having each thread know which bone(s) affect it, then a second pass or same pass with careful ordering for the blend step. (Blend reads from and writes to the same buffer, so either two buffers ping-pong or structure the blend so writes don’t conflict — e.g. blend bindings write into bound vertex indices, which are not written in the blend phase.)

Alternatively, we could **pre-convert** the mesh to a conventional format (e.g. per-vertex up to N bone indices and weights) and use **vertex-shader skinning**; that would require a one-time conversion and might approximate the current blend behavior rather than match it exactly.

### 5.4 What stays on CPU vs GPU

| Data | Today | Advanced (GPU deformation) |
|------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Undeformed mesh (verts, norms, UVs, indices, bone/blend bindings) | CPU | GPU (upload once) |
| Skeleton (rest pose, hierarchy) | CPU | GPU (upload once) |
| Animation (motions, keyframes) | CPU | Optional: GPU (for Option B) |
| Current bone poses (world position, rotation) | CPU every frame | Option A: CPU computes, upload matrices. Option B: GPU computes from time. |
| Deformed vertices/normals | CPU every frame → upload | GPU only (compute output → render input) |

### 5.5 Benefits

- **No per-frame vertex upload:** Deformed mesh stays on GPU; only small uniform/buffer updates (bone matrices or time).
- **Scalability:** Many characters mean many small compute dispatches and draws, not huge CPU→GPU vertex streams.
- **Pipeline clarity:** Load → upload assets once; each frame: update pose (or time), run deformation, draw. Same mental model as “holodeck”: static and skinned data on GPU, animate on that side of the divide.

This document is the single design reference for the WebGPU upgrade and advanced Sims-style renderer features; implementation can be done incrementally with AI-assisted development and typically shortens the calendar time (e.g. full refactor in a few days with AI assist).
